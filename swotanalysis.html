                    <h2>Strengths</h1>
                        <p>One of my strengths is my curiosity. It comes in handy when I don't know how to write a
                            certain part of
                            my code and need to do research. Moreover, I am flexible, which is very useful when my code
                            doesn't
                            work, because I try to think of other ways to achieve my final goal.</p>

                    <h2>Weaknesses</h1>
                        <p>I struggle with organization. It has never impacted my performance until now, however, it is
                            hard for me
                            to plan the structure of my code beforehand.

                    <h2>Threats</h1>
                        <p>One of the obstacles I face is that I wait until the last moment to do my assignments. This
                            could be
                            crucial for the success of my studies. That's why I will be focus on that and try to change
                            it now that
                            I at university. </p>

                    <h2>Opportunities</h1>
                        <p>If I prioritise my weaknesses it will allow me to work on them more and improve in these
                            fields. This
                            could be very helpful when it comes to working in a company. This also includes stepping
                            outside of my
                            comfort zone. If I do that I would be able to make my weaknesses an opportunity.</p>
