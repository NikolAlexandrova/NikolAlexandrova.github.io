            <p>I am studying ICT in the Netherlands.</p>
            <h2>Why did I choose to study it?</h2>
            <p> The ICT program is incredibly captivating, offering me remarkable flexibility. It liberates me from the
                constraints of specializing in just one aspect of the vast IT realm. Instead, it encourages me to
                explore diverse domains and seamlessly blend my various interests.

                For instance, I'm passionate about programming, yet I find immense satisfaction in shaping the interface
                of apps and designing websites. What's even more intriguing is how this program keeps me motivated. Time
                seems to fly by as I immerse myself in my studies, experiencing the joy of learning without stress.

                Additionally, a major driving force for me is the program's potential to grant me the freedom to work
                and travel worldwide, amplifying my enthusiasm and motivation. </p>

            <h2>Do I have any experience with it so far?</h2>
            <p> My journey into the realm of Computer Science commenced in the eleventh grade, and I've since dedicated
                two years to its study. In addition to my academic coursework, I actively pursued personal programming
                lessons that delved deeper into the intricacies of programming languages such as Java and SQL.

                Furthermore, I seized an invaluable opportunity with an internship at a reputable company, where I
                gained practical experience in handling JSON files and honed the skill of converting them into Java
                objects. This hands-on experience greatly enriched my understanding of real-world applications in the
                field of Computer Science. </p>
            <h2>What are my plans after the study?</h2>
            <p>I would like to work in an IT company either as a software engineer or business IT consultant. With
                time
                I would like to achieve a higher position and transfer to a bigger company.</p>
