            <p>I am studying ICT in the Netherlands.</p>
            <h2>Why did I choose to study it?</h2>
            <p> I chose to study ICT because it is interesting and allows me to be flexible. I don't need to focus on
                only one field of the IT world. It enables me to explore more and combine my interests. For example, I
                like programming but I also enjoy the part in which I have to choose how the interface of an app should
                look or how a website should be done. Additionally, the profession that this program offers me enables
                me to travel around the world without having to sit in an office the whole day. </p>

            <h2>Do I have any experience with it so far?</h2>
            <p> I started studying Computer science in eleventh grade so I've been studying it for two years now.
                Along
                with my studies in school, I had personal programming lessons, where I got more deeply into the
                programming languages Java and SQL. Moreover, I also had an internship at a company, which helped me
                learn how to work with JSON files and how to convert them to Java objects. </p>
            <h2>What are my plans after the study?</h2>
            <p>I would like to work in an IT company either as a software engineer or business IT consultant. With
                time
                I would like to achieve a higher position and transfer to a bigger company.</p>
