                    <h1> Personal Information </h1>
<p> </p>
<h1> Motivate your study choice </h1>
<p> I chose to study this programme because it aligns perfectly with my interests. Moreover,  it allows me to be flexible - to go study abroad, work a part- time job and travel without worrying that I won't be able to do my assignments. </p>
<h1> After completing the study... </h1>
<p> After graduating I would like to work in a well-known company and in a great environment. For now, I am not sure which path I would like to undertake more - Software Engineer or Business IT Consultant. Both interest me so I hope that during university I will get more acquainted with the work I should be doing in both professions. </p>

    <h1> Personal SWOT analysis</h1>
    <h2> Strengths </h2>
    <p> One of my strengths is my curiosity. It comes in handy when I don't know how to write a certain part of my code and need to do a research. Moreover I am flexible, which is very useful when my code doesn't work, because I try to think of other ways to achieve my final goal. </p>
    <h2> Weaknesses </h2>
    <p> I struggle with organisation. It has never impacted my performance until now,  however it is hard for me to plan the structure of my code beforehand. </p>
    <h2> Opportunities</h2>
    <p> If I prioritise my weaknesses it will allow me to work on them more and improve in this fields. This could be very helpful when it comes to working in a company. This also includes stepping outside of my comfort zone. If I do that I would be able to make my weaknesses an opportunities. </p>
    <h2> Threats</h2>
    <p> One of the obstacles I face is that I wait for the last moment to do my assignments. This could be crucial for the success of my studies. That's why I will be focus on that and try to change it now that I at university. </p>
    <h1> EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES (e.g. student job and leisure) </h1>
    <p> I am planning to work alongside my studies. In my free time I like to go out with friends and watch movies. I am good at keeping a work-life balance so I believe that I won't have any problem with combining these things with my study. Moreover, I believe that some of them could be combined. For example, I can go out with friends and have a study session with  them.  </p>
    <h1> Study choice activities</h1>
    <p> I had personal programming lessons. Moreover, I studied Computer Science at school and did an internship at a company. </p>
